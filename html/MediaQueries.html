            <h2>Bonifacio Global City</h2>    
            <p>Bonifacio Global City (also known as BGC, Global City, or The Fort) is a financial and lifestyle district in Taguig, Metro Manila, Philippines. 
                It is located 11 km (6.8 mi) south-east of the center of Manila. The district experienced commercial growth following the sale of military land by 
                the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA). The entire district used to be the part of the main Philippine Army camp.
                It is under the administration of the city government of Taguig. The local governments of Makati and Pateros also claim jurisdiction.
                
                In February 7, 1995, Bonifacio Land Development Corporation (BLDC) started planning a major urban developmentâ€”Bonifacio Global City. 
                BLDC made a successful bid to become BCDA's partner in the development of the district. The Ayala Corporation through Ayala Land, Inc., 
                and Evergreen Holdings, Inc. of the Campos Group purchased a controlling stake in BLDC from Metro Pacific in 2003. BCDA and the two companies 
                now control Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation, which oversees the master planning of Bonifacio Global City.
